# mercury-gulp-boilerplate

This is a starter project for [mercury][1] using [gulp.js][2], [browserify][3],
[es6-browserify][4], [mercury-jsxify][5], and [sass][6]. I worked on this as a
learning exercise, so would appreciate any suggestions or pull requests.

## Install

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies into a local `node_modules` directory. Then,
use the `watch` task to start a local dev server on port 9000:

```shell
gulp watch
```

To build a minified distributable, use the `dist` task:

```shell
gulp dist
```

## Features

This gulp project includes the following features:

- browserify bundling
- live reload
- jsx compilation
- es6 support (limited)
- sass/scss compilation

## Opinions/Assumptions

- I tried to build a class-based component system. In this boilerplate, there
is no distinction between controllers and views - the view is simply a `render`
method on the component class.
